# Truth-Seeker
A Bayesian inference project exploring how beliefs evolve with data
A story in three simulations about bias, evidence, and belief.

---

## Overview

In a world full of noisy data, how do we find the truth?
This project explores three classic Bayesian dilemmas.

---

## Simulations

### Simulation 1: How Much Evidence Do You Need?

You're flipping a possibly biased coin. How many flips do you need to revise your beliefs? Explore how priors and data interact.

### Simulation 2: How Sure Should You Be?

A patient tests positive for a rare disease. Should you be alarmed? This simulation shows the hidden power of base rates.

### Simulation 3: How Wrong Are You?

A witness identifies someone in a police lineup. But what are the odds the suspect is actually guilty? Watch how priors, accuracy, and error rates collide.
